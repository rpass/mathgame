- Add scoring system with negative points and percentage grade.
DONE	- count correct answers
DONE	- count incorrect attempts
DONE	- calculate accuracy (%)
	- parse the input to be fair. (ex. .75 is seen as 0.75 and 0.12 or 0.13 is correct)

- Create timing feature
done	- report speed of each question from posting to answering correctly
	- use total time to report average time taken
	- save each time and question for analytics
- Add analytics engine
 	- record types of question
 	- sum scores on questions by their type
 	- report scores per type of question
 	- TYPES : single-digit-addition, double-digit, multi-digit, multi-operand, mixed-operator, etc.
- Add difficulty
DONE	- 2,3,4 digit operands
DONE	- random length digit operands (between 0 and 4)
done 	- remove 0 from list of possible operands (or reduce frequency)
DONE	- decide whether single digit problems should have a single line format ( x + y = ___) and the larger (>= 2) digit problems should change their format to multi-line (x /n y +/n)?
	- add multiple (> 2) operand problems
DONE - Keep a question up until answered correctly.
DONE	-allow user to set range of difficulty before hand
DONE	-allow user to set random or no random difficulty at start


- Formatting
	- make it look pretty
	- clean up the UI class

- Error checking
	-Check and handle an exit before game begins (0/0 problem)
	- properly handle functions that are yet to be implemented

- Expand
DONE-ish	-Generalise the question class
	-Create child classes for ratioQuestion, SubtractionQuestion, etc.
- Expand to Ratios
- Expand to statistics
done - Expand to subtraction
	- Allow user to choose "mode" or add/sub/mult/div before starting ... 

----
Ratios
----

1) Setup a ratio question
2) Setup margin of error correctness

-------------------------------------
GOAL:

To improve my mental calculation and a more intuitive understanding of figures.
